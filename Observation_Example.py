## Context
"""
This example is an extension of the Perturbed Satellite Orbit Application. It adopts the simulation setup from the Perturbed Satellite Orbit, considering a slightly reduced set of perturbing accelerations for the propagation of the vehicle.

The script demonstrates how the basic numerical simulation setup (aiming to propagate the state of the system) can swiftly be extended to enable a study of the system's sensitivity.

Via the `estimation_setup.parameter module`, the system parameters w.r.t. which the sensitivity is to be studied are defined and a SingleArcVariationalSimulator object from the numerical_simulation module is used in order to setup and integrate the system's variational equations. After obtaining the state transition matrices from the integrated variational equations, the system's response to small perturbations can be tested via simple matrix multiplication.

The availability of variational equations in tudat enables many more, advanced functionalities, such as covariance analysis and precise orbit determination.

## Import statements
"""
The required import statements are made here, at the very beginning.

Some standard modules are first loaded. These are `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

Then, the different modules of `tudatpy` that will be used are imported.

### Create the bodies
"""
Bodies can be created by making a list of strings with the bodies that is to be included in the simulation.

The default body settings (such as atmosphere, body shape, rotation model) are taken from `SPICE`.

These settings can be adjusted. Please refere to the [Available Environment Models](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup/create_models/available.html#available-environment-models) in the user guide for more details.

Finally, the system of bodies is created using the settings. This system of bodies is stored into the variable `bodies`.

When setting up the radiation pressure interface, the Earth is set as a body that can occult the radiation emitted by the Sun.

    - Mars
    - Venus
* Gravitational acceleration using a Spherical Harmonic approximation up to degree and order 5 from Earth.
* Aerodynamic acceleration from Earth.
* Acceleration caused by the radiation pressure of the Sun on the vehicle approximated as a cannonball.

The acceleration settings defined are then applied to `Delfi-C3` in a dictionary.

The initial state of the vehicle that will be propagated is now defined. 

This initial state always has to be provided as a cartesian state, in the form of a list with the first three elements reprensenting the initial position, and the three remaining elements representing the initial velocity.

In this example, since we wish to propagate the variational equations in addition to the satellite state, we use the `SingleArcVariationalSimulator()` function (instead of the `SingleArcSimulator()` function that we would normally use).

This function takes additional arguments: the parameters that have to be estimated, and a boolean to specify that the parameters will be intergrated immidiately when the function is called.
